        <p>Yes,one of the people which annoyed us while playing prototype 1 for the first time is Specialist Robert Cross.He got insanely strong armor and has mastered hand to hand combat skills.
            He has got a complex launcher too by which he launches many missiles. He gave a tough fight to Alex Mercer before getting smacked in the face.He also got a baton from which he fights in melee combat.His extremely fast reflexes earn him a spot in the list.
            He got defeated by Alex Mercer and killed and consumed by Supreme Hunter.

        <p>Designed to fight superhuman beings like hunters(infected monsters of blacklight virus) posess superhuman strength,speed,agility,reflexes can run on the buildings like normal roads.They can block attacks from Alex Mercer's Blade and counter very easily.They can cause a big whole in the iron with just a punch but are vulnerable to counters.They are a big threat for Alex Mercer while infiltrating military base.Their these factors and armor earn them a spot on the list.
          They are humans ,this is their only weakness.They can go toe to toe with a hunter.

        <p>Yup,the most powerful character in prototype is the blacklight virus itself Alex Mercer.He kicked ass of supreme hunter,elizabethe greene,mother,Leader hunters,James Heller and every kind of monster.He has consumed more than a thousand infected and has become so powerful that even the nuclear nuke couldn't kill him.He is the only prototype who has grown immunity to bloodtox the cure of the virus and was the one responsible for destroying it too.He has got strength that he can lift a whole specter tank with one hand and throw it in space.For Killing he has got blade powerful ,damaging,lethal and razor sharp,the claws for pouncing attacks,muscle mass for multplying his strength,the hammerfists for crushing,the whipfist for long range attacks.His devestators are 2x of James Heller. His devestators are capable of destroying anything that comes into its radius and are very long range.He has killed mother(Elizabeth greene),supreme hunter and almost every infected monster and defeated James Heller.He is the most powerful character in prototype universe.Heller was only able to defeat him because of the story without the plot armor Heller wouldn't stand a chance against him.He has got an armor which is indestructible it cannot break no matter what.I  </p>
